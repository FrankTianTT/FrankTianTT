Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Frank Tian.

I am a graduate student at Nanjing University in China with a passion for exploring the development of artificial intelligence. Currently, I am fully immersed in research on reinforcement learning and its intersection with causal discovery and inference. Alongside my academic pursuits, I maintain a keen interest in physics and astronomy and seek to uncover ways to construct general artificial intelligence through natural laws.

You can contact with me by [nju-mail](mailto:tianhl@lamda.nju.edu.cn) or [gmail](mailto:franktian424@gmail.com), however the latter one is not checked often.
