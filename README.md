Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Frank Tian.

I'm a student from Nanjing University in China, and I'm interested in learning&researching Artificial Intelligence, specially Deep Reinforcement Learning right now.

There is my [blog](http://franktiantt.github.io/) which is deployed in Github's server, and you can visit [this](http://blog.franktian.xyz/) in China. Just in case, I've also deployed my site on Gitee, which you can click [here](http://franktian424.gitee.io/) to visit, but I don't often update it. (free accounts need to be updated manually:(

You can contact with me by [qq-mail](mailto:franktian424@qq.com) or [gmail](mailto:franktian424@gmail.com), however the latter one is not checked often. 


Come look at my GitHub record:
