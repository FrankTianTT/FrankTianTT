Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Frank Tian.

I'm a student from Nanjing University in China, and I'm interested in Artificial Intelligence, specially Deep Reinforcement Learning and Causal Inference&Discovery right now.

You can contact with me by [qq-mail](mailto:franktian424@qq.com) or [gmail](mailto:franktian424@gmail.com), however the latter one is not checked often.
